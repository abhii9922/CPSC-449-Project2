How to use endpoints
HTTP verbs | endpoints | Action

To register a new user: http POST tuffix-vm/auth/register username={user} password={pass}
To create a game: http -a {user}:{pass} POST tuffix-vm/games/create
To make a guess: http -a {user}:{pass} POST tuffix-vm/games/{gameid} guess={guess}
To list in-progress games : http -a {user}:{pass} GET tuffix-vm/users/{username}
To retrieve game state : http -a {user}:{pass} GET tuffix-vm/games/{gameid}

Furthermore, you can view these endpoints in Quart Schema Documentation form when the server is running by navigating to tuffix-vm/games/docs or tuffix/users/docs in a web browser!
